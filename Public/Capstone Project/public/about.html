    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            With over 10 years of experience in high-pressure, fast-paced environments as both a kitchen professional<br>
            and a touring musician, I’ve developed a strong foundation in leadership, multitasking, time management,<br>
            and team collaboration. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail,<br>
            and ability to stay calm and effective under pressure — all traits that I’m now channeling into my growing<br>
            passion for technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently building my skills in web development, with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I approach<br>
            coding with the same creativity, discipline, and work ethic that has guided my success on stage and in the<br>
            kitchen. As a Passionate hardworker, and a fast learner, I’m eager to contribute to a forward-thinking tech team<br>
            where I can continue to grow and apply both my technical, creative, and interpersonal strengths.
