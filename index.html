        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
          With over 10 years of experience in high-pressure, fast-paced
          environments as both a kitchen professional and a touring musician,
          I’ve developed a strong foundation in leadership, multitasking, time
          management, and team collaboration. These experiences have sharpened
          my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and ability to stay
          calm and effective under pressure — all traits that I’m now channeling
          into my growing passion for technology.<br />

          I’m currently building my skills in web development, with a focus on
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I approach coding with the same creativity,
          discipline, and work ethic that has guided my success on stage and in
          the kitchen. As a Passionate hardworker, and a fast learner, I’m eager
          to contribute to a forward-thinking tech team where I can continue to
          grow and apply both my technical, creative, and interpersonal
          strengths.
